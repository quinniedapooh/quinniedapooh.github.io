            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey there! My name is <strong>Quinton Wong</strong> and I'm a 4th-year <em>Computer Science</em> student with a potential minor in <em>Chinese</em>. I serve as <strong>Treasurer</strong> for <em>Hui 'O Hawai'i</em> and work as a <strong>Student Assistant</strong> for the <em>Men & Masculinities Center</em>. </p> 
            <p>When I'm not busy with school and work, I love to go for long runs, knit, and hang out with my friends. I'm always interested in learning new skills and enjoy getting to connect with others.</p>
